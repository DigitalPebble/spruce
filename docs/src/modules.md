# Enrichment modules

SPRUCE generates the estimates above by chaining **EnrichmentModules**, each of them relying on columns found in the usage reports or produced by preceding modules.

For instance, the [AverageCarbonIntensity.java](https://github.com/DigitalPebble/spruce/blob/main/src/main/java/com/digitalpebble/spruce/modules/electricitymaps/AverageCarbonIntensity.java) module applies average carbon intensity factors to energy estimates based on the region in order to generate _operational emissions_.

The list of columns generated by the modules can be found in the [SpruceColumn](https://github.com/DigitalPebble/spruce/blob/main/src/main/java/com/digitalpebble/spruce/SpruceColumn.java) class.

The enrichment modules are listed and configured in a configuration file. If no configuration is specified, the [default one](https://github.com/DigitalPebble/spruce/blob/main/src/main/resources/default-config.json) is used.
See [Configure the modules](howto/config_modules.md) for instructions on how to modify the enrichment modules.

## ccf.Storage

Provides an estimate of energy used for storage by applying a flat coefficient per Gb, following the approach used by the [Cloud Carbon Footprint](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/) project.
See [methodology](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/docs/methodology#storage) for more details.

Populates the column `energy_usage_kwh`.

## ccf.Networking

Provides an estimate of energy used for networking in and out of data centres. Applies a flat coefficient per Gb, following the approach used by the [Cloud Carbon Footprint](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/) project.
See [methodology](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/docs/methodology#storage) for more details.

Populates the column `energy_usage_kwh`.

## boavizta.BoaviztAPI

Provides an estimate of [final energy](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/primary-and-final-energy-consumption) used for computation (EC2, OpenSearch, RDS) as well as the related embodied emissions using the [BoaviztAPI](https://doc.api.boavizta.org/).

Populates the columns `energy_usage_kwh`, `embodied_emissions_co2eq_g` and `embodied_adp_gsbeq`. 

From https://doc.api.boavizta.org/Explanations/impacts/ 

**Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP)** is an environmental impact indicator. This category corresponds to mineral and resources used and is, in this sense, mainly influenced by the rate of resources extracted. The effect of this consumption on their depletion is estimated according to their availability stock at a global scale. This impact category is divided into two components: a material component and a fossil fuels component (we use a version of ADP which include both).
This impact is expressed in grams of antimony equivalent (gSbeq).

## boavizta.BoaviztAPIstatic

Similar to the previous module but does not get the information from an instance of the BoaviztAPI but from a static file generated from it. This makes it simpler to use SPRUCE.

## ccf.PUE

Applies a fixed ratio for [Power Usage_Effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_usage_effectiveness) to row for which energy usage has been estimated, following the approach used by the [Cloud Carbon Footprint](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/) project.
See [CCF methodology](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/docs/methodology/#pue) for more details.

Populates the column `power_usage_effectiveness`.

## electricitymaps.AverageCarbonIntensity

Adds average carbon intensity factors generated from [ElectricityMaps](https://www.electricitymaps.com/)' 2024 datasets.
The [life-cycle](https://portal.electricitymaps.com/developer-hub/api/getting-started#emission-factors) emission factors are used.

Populates the columns `carbon_intensity`.

## OperationalEmissions

Computes operational emissions based on the energy usage, average carbon intensity factors and `power_usage_effectiveness` estimated by the preceding modules.

Populates the columns `operational_emissions_co2eq_g`.

`operational_emissions_co2eq_g` is equal to `energy_usage_kwh` * `carbon_intensity` * `power_usage_effectiveness`.
