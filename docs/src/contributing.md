# Contributing to Spruce
============================

Thank you for your intention to contribute to Spruce. As an open-source community, we highly appreciate contributions to our project.

To make the process smooth for the project *committers* (those who review and accept changes) and *contributors* (those who propose new changes via pull requests), there are a few rules to follow.

## Contribution Guidelines

We use GitHub Issues and Pull Requests for tracking contributions. We
expect participants to adhere to the GitHub Community Guidelines (found
at <https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/> ) as well as our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Please note that your contributions will be under the [ASF v2 license](LICENSE).

### Get Involved

The Spruce project is developed by volunteers and is always looking for new contributors to work on all parts of the project.
Every contribution is welcome and needed to make it better. A contribution can be anything from a small documentation typo fix to a new component. We especially welcome contributions from first-time users.

#### GitHub Discussions

Feel free to use GitHub Discussions to ask any questions you might have when planning your first contribution.

### Making a Contribution

- Create a new issue on GitHub. Please describe the problem or improvement in the body of the issue. For larger issues, please open a new discussion and describe the problem.
- Next, create a pull request in GitHub.

Contributors who have a history of successful participation are invited to join the project as a committer.
