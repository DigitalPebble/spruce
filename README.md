*Spruce* helps estimate the environmental impact of your cloud usage. By leveraging open source models and data, it enriches
usage reports generated by cloud providers and allows you to build reports and visualisations. Having the greenops and finops data in the same 
place makes it easier to expose your costs and impacts side by side.

*Spruce* uses [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) to read and write the usage reports (typically in Parquet format) in a scalable way and, thanks to its modular approach, 
splits the enrichment of the data into configurable stages.

A typical sequence of stages would be:
- estimation of embedded emissions from resources used
- estimation of energy used
- application of PUE and other overheads
- application of carbon intensity factors

Please note that this is currently a prototype which handles only CUR reports from AWS. Not all AWS services are covered.

One of the benefits of using Apache Spark is that you can use [EMR on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/spark/) to enrich 
the CURs at scale without having to export or expose any of your data.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have CUR reports as inputs. Those are generated via [DataExports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-data-exports.html) and stored on S3 as Parquet files.

## Local install

With Apache Maven, Java and Apache Spark installed locally and added to the $PATH.

```
mvn clean package
spark-submit --class com.digitalpebble.spruce.SparkJob --driver-memory 8g ./target/spruce-1.0.jar ./config.json ./curs ./output
```

## Docker

Build the Docker image with
`docker build -t digitalpebble/spruce:1.0 .`

The command below processes the data locally by mounting the directories containing the CURs and output as volumes:
```
docker run -it  -v ./config.json:/tmp/spruce-config.json  -v ./curs:/curs -v ./output:/output  digitalpebble/spruce:1.0 \
/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit  \
--class com.digitalpebble.spruce.SparkJob \
--driver-memory 4g \
--master 'local[*]' \
/usr/local/lib/spruce-1.0.jar \
/tmp/spruce-config.json /curs /output/enriched
```

## Explore the output

Using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) locally or [Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html) on AWS:

```sql
create table enriched_curs as select * from 'output/*/*.parquet';

select line_item_product_code, product_servicecode, 
       round(sum(operational_emissions_co2eq_g),2) as co2_usage_g, 
       round(sum(energy_usage_kwh),2) as energy_usage_kwh 
       from enriched_curs where operational_emissions_co2eq_g > 0.01 
       group by line_item_product_code, product_servicecode order by co2_usage_g desc;
```

should give an output similar to

| line_item_product_code | product_servicecode | co2_usage_g | energy_usage_kwh |
|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------------|
| AmazonS3               | AWSDataTransfer     | 659.2       | 3.31             |
| AmazonRDS              | AWSDataTransfer     | 361.59      | 1.09             |
| AmazonEC2              | AWSDataTransfer     | 162.59      | 1.43             |
| AmazonECR              | AWSDataTransfer     | 88.75       | 0.8              |
| AmazonVPC              | AWSDataTransfer     | 40.55       | 0.38             |
| AWSELB                 | AWSDataTransfer     | 6.3         | 0.06             |

To measure the proportion of the costs for which emissions where calculated

```sql
select
  round(covered * 100 / "total costs", 2) as percentage_costs_covered
from (
  select
    sum(line_item_unblended_cost) as "total costs",
    sum(line_item_unblended_cost) filter (where operational_emissions_co2eq_g is not null) as covered
  from
    enriched_curs
  where
    line_item_line_item_type like '%Usage'
);
```
